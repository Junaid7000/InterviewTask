# InterviewTask
my Interview task for tessellate imaging.

Task 1 is leaf classification dataset from kaggle (you can find it here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/leaf-classification)
Task 1 (image features) is same classification as Task 1, but using features as images, Accuracy is low :(

Task 2 is fruit images for object detection dataset (you can find it here: https://www.kaggle.com/mbkinaci/fruit-images-for-object-detection1 )
